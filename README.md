Checkers
----------------------
Checkers was created to see what I could do with the concepts I learned from CS250 & parts of CS251. I had the goal of recreating a well-known simple game to test my current abilities and to see where I need to improve. I used Java because that is the language I have been using in CS250 & CS251. The game was playable from the console, however, I found it to be tedious as I would constantly update a google spreadsheet with a mock 8x8 board, this was my inspiration to evolve from using the console to making it fully playable on a GUI. I chose Java's Swing GUI to make this possible because I am familiar with the language so it seemed like a good pick for a beginner.
